# week-4-game

This game allows the player to select from any of four characters, and then do battle with the remaining three.

It is possible to win (and lose) with all four characters.  The attack potential of each character is proportional to their hitpoints - that is, the lower their initial hit points, the higher their attack potential.  This potential is governed by a random element, to make the game more interesting and the outcome less sure.
